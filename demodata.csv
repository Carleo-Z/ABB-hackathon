L4,TT-117 H or HH,Steam accidentally flowing into H100.,"1) Turn off XV-140 and FCV-110 from the control room. 
2) Turn off manual valves V100, V101, V102.3) If TT-117  still displays a high value in the control room, send an engineer on site to check the temperature meter reading and see if there is discrepancy between on-site reading and control room reading. If there is a difference, follow the black electric cables and look for the electric box that the cables are connected to. Report the electric box number  to the control room personnel and phone the electrician to repair the flowmeter.",Temperature alarm
K8,LT-101 L or LL,Low level in stripper due to increase in pump speed.,Decrease pump speed by 5%.,Level alarm
K15,LT-108 H or HH,The recycled MEA has accidentally entered the top of the absorber column. This is causing the absorber column to fill up.,"First turn off solenoid valve SOV-123 from the control room.
Then, turn off manual valves V119b, V119a, V198b, V198a, V212, V211, V213.",Level alarm
M11,PDT-105 H or HH,"Pump speed increases too quickly, or there is a filter blockage.","1) Observe the value of pressure in Z102 via the control room screen. If alarm is caused by the large increase in pump speed, pressure will reduce without interference over time.
2) If pressure does not reduce and is at high value consistently, this is very likely a filter blockage, and one should do the following:a.	From the control room, acknowledge the alarm indicating a pressure difference reading greater than expected coming from PDT105 (0.45bar), or the alarm indicating a low flow through FT-103 and FT-104.
b.	An operator then needs to make their way down to the first floor and first open the manual valve V120 and then close manual valves V117a and V117b.
c.	The operator should then open the manual valve V122 to drain the filter - PID shows V118 as the valve from Z102, but it is labelled as V122. (The labels have been swapped).
d.	Monitor the value of PDT 105 which should read a value of 0 if the filter has been successfully isolated.
e.	A member of the maintenance team should be informed to fix the filter.",Pressure alarm
M11,PDT-105 L or LL,Large decrease in pump speed causes low differential pressure across the filter. ,Pressure will return without interference.,Pressure alarm

2) Turn off manual valves V100, V101, V102.
3) If FT-100 still displays a high value in the control room, send an engineer on site to check the flow meter reading and see if there is discrepancy between on-site reading and control room reading. If there is a difference, follow the black electric cables and look for the electric box that the cables are connected to.
